\usage{
position_dodgex(
  width = NULL,
  hexpand = NA,
  vexpand = NA,
  preserve = c("total", "single")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{width}{Dodging width, when different to the width of the individual
elements. This is useful when you want to align narrow geoms with wider
geoms.}

\item{hexpand}{numeric, Horizon expand for geoms that have a position, default is NA.}

\item{vexpand}{numeric, Vertical expand for geoms that have a position, default is NA.}

\item{preserve}{Should dodging preserve the total width of all elements
at a position, or the width of a single element?}
}
\description{
Dodging preserves the vertical position of an geom while adjusting the
horizontal position. \code{position_dodge2} is a special case of \code{position_dodge}
for arranging box plots, which can have variable widths. \code{position_dodge2}
also works with bars and rectangles. But unlike \code{position_dodge},
\code{position_dodge2} works without a grouping variable in a layer.
