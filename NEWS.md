  should be started with zero. (20200601)

# 0.0.0.2

+ The distance between the panel and tree can be adjusted 
  using the "offset". The value of associate panel were 
  normalized in the range of x of tree. The width can be 
  adjusted using the "pratio". The "offset" and "pratio" 
  are the ratio related to tree. (20200529)
