# ggadd: add layers which can be shifted horizontally or vertically.

The layers of ‘ggplot’ can be added, they will be overlaped if ‘x’ and
‘y’ are in the same range. However, sometimes we want to visualize
them separately. In cartesian coordinate system, this problem can be
solved by ‘facet’, But in polar coordinate system, The ‘facet’ can not
do this. To solve the problem, this package was developed.
