Description: The layers of 'ggplot' can be added, they will be overlaped if 'x' and 
             'y' are in the same range. However, sometimes we want to visualize them 
             separately. In cartesian coordinate system, this problem can be solved 
             by 'facet', But in polar coordinate system, The 'facet' can not do this. 
             To solve the problem, this package was developed.
