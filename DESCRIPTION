Description: The layers of 'ggplot' can be added using '+', they will be overlaped if 
             'x' and 'y' are in the same range. However, sometimes we want to visualize 
             them separately. In cartesian coordinate system, this problem can be solved 
             by 'facet', But in polar coordinate system, The 'facet' can not do this. 
             To solve the problem, this package was developed. The application of this 
             package is that it can add some layers on the tree of "ggtree".
